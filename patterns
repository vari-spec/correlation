recognise the bot patterns. but the bots are trying hard to figure out whether we're human or bots, throwing turing tests back at us. 

When can i fully inhavit my shadow identity built with a UUID and a blob of weakly hashed data, the identity built behind my back, a version no less than the oen
i put on for work, the one i test out to see how it fits. I just didn't know about the shadow at all, it was deliberately kept away from me in their databases. 

Why shouldn't i have it to use as i want? if i want to be a set of statistical probabilities processed into certainties why shouldn't i?
